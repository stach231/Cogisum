# Cogisum

## About
Cogisum is my original web logic game written in React and TypeScript.

## Rules
The player's goal is to reach the target score, which is different for each game.</br>
This can be done by clicking on the number-balls.</br>
Each value on each of the number-balls results in a different change in the actual value.</br>
The player must remember the changes to finish the game.
